/**
 * ACE (Agent Context Event Protocol) 0.1 runtime.
 *
 * Protocol semantics follow `ACE-RFC-Draft-0.1.md`; the engineering layout
 * follows `ace-v0.1.md`. The runtime is a boundary layer: transports carry raw
 * messages, this package validates them and applies activation semantics, and an
 * {@link AgentEngine} (see `PiAdapter`) turns them into agent work.
